## Poetry Portfolio Elevator Pitch

I am an English major, and many of my friends are also English majors, which has led me to the realization that most of my English-major friends do not understand technology. As slightly techno-phobic individuals, publishing and storing things they create online can be overwhelming or scary. This web application would fill a presently empty space for people to upload their own poetry to a public platform, sorted by user, simply built for easy access, easy contribution, and easy storage. Another aspect of this web app would include the option to search other people's poetry either by their tag or their profile. It could be useful in poetry classes at universities or high schools for teachers and students to read each other's works easily. 

## Poetry Portfolio Key Features

- **Sign in/login:** *HTML* will structure the login page and sign-up page, *CSS* will style the form, *Javascript* will handle the submission and validation, and I'll need a database to keep track of the users. Maybe this database would be created with *SQL*.
- **Voting/liking poems:** Voting on a poem would use *HTML* to create the like button at the end of a poem, *CSS* would style it, *JavaScript/React* would handle the user interactions with the button and update the UI to reflect the current number of likes. 
- **Showing popular poems/sorting poems by tags:** *HTML* would create the basic layout for displaying poems and filtering options. *CSS* would style the poem listings, filters, and popular poem section. *JavaScript* would fetch and display poems from the backend, handle filtering by tags, and sort poems based on popularity.
