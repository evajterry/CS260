## Poetry Portfolio Elevator Pitch

I am an English major, and many of my friends are also English majors, which has led me to the realization that most of my English-major friends do not understand technology. As slightly techno-phobic individuals, publishing and storing things they create online can be overwhelming or scary. This web application would fill a presently empty space for people to upload their own poetry to a public platform, sorted by user, simply built for easy access, easy contribution, and easy storage. Another aspect of this web app would include the option to search other people's poetry either by their tag or their profile. It could be useful in poetry classes at universities or high schools for teachers and students to read each other's works easily.
